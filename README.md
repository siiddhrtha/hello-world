just another repository
i am learning to code.

*C Language 

C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write an operating system. 

Features:

# Include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like operating system or compiler development.

# Fast and Efficient.

* C++ Language

C++, high-level computer programming language. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup of Bell Laboratories in the early 1980s, it is based on the traditional C language but with added object-oriented programming and other capabilities. 

Features:

# Machine Independent or Portable.

# Mid-level programming language. 


* Cobol Language 

COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on the programming language FLOW-MATIC designed by Grace Hopper. It was created as part of a US Department of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing.

Features:

 # COBOL is an easy-to-learn, standard language that can be compiled and executed on a variety of computers. It supports a wide syntax vocabulary and features an uncluttered coding style.
 
# The logical control structures available in COBOL make it easy to read, modify and debug. COBOL is also scalable, reliable and portable across platforms.

*Scala Language

Scala is a modern programming language designed and created by Martin Odersky. The design of the language started in 2001 and was released to the public in early 2004. Martin Odersky had a huge hand in the implementation of javac (the primary Java compiler) and also designed Generic Java, a facility of generic programming that was added to the Java programming language in 2004. This is why it doesn’t come as a surprise that Scala is similar to Java in many aspects, it’s actually written to run in JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

Features:

# Case classes and Pattern matching.

# Singleton object.

* Matlab Language

MATLAB is a programming language developed by MathWorks. It started out as a matrix programming language where linear algebra programming was simple. It can be run both under interactive sessions and as a batch job. This tutorial gives you aggressively a gentle introduction of MATLAB programming language.
 

Features:

# MATLAB can natively support the sensor, video, image, telemetry, binary, and various real-time data from JDBC/ODBC databases. Reading data from different databases, CSV, audio, images, and video is super simple from an integrated environment.

# It offers a huge library of mathematical functions needed for computing statistics, linear algebra, numerical integration, filtering, Fourier analysis, optimization and solving regular differential equations.
